## Welcome! ##

This is the start page for information about [Simbrain](http://www.simbrain.net/) development. Simbrain is an open source project, and it goes without saying that we could use your help. If you've found a bug, can suggest an improvement to the interface, would like to add features, etc., join us, or feel free to post a message to our [forum](http://simbrain.963258.n4.nabble.com/).

**Note** that this page will be migrated to github some time before August 2015, when [google code goes read only](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html).

Select _File >  New > Java Project_

In the Contents pane, select _Create project from existing source_. Click _Browse_ and select the Simbrain source directory (either "simbrain" or "simbrain-read-only").

Leave all other _New Java Project_ options as defaulted and select _Finish_. The Simbrain directory has now been added to your Eclipse Package Explorer as either "simbrain" or "simbrain-read-only".

Right-click the Simbrain directory in your Eclipse Package Explorer and select _Run As > Java Application_. You will be prompted by a _Select Java Application_ window. In the search field, type "Splasher" then select the corresponding item in the list below. Select _Ok_. Assuming there are no errors, you've just successfully run Simbrain from Eclipse.
